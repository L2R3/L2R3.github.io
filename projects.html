            <p>
                Programming an OpenMANIPULATOR-X to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle with an unkown starting configuration and without the use of additional sensors. This project was part of the coursework of the Robotic Manipulation module and was carried out in a group of 3 members.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forward and inverse kinematics were derived and implemented. Current-based position control is used to determine the starting configuration, and cartesian space cubic interpolation is used for movements. The end-effector as well as the disks and towers were designed and 3D-printed. Other tasks of the coursework included moving, rotating and stacking cubes, as well as drawing simple geometric shapes made of straight lines and arcs.

            <img src="/projects/CR01A.jpg" alt="GUI" style="height:300px;">
            <p>
                A proof-of-concept cleanroom sensing IOT solution, written in Rust on Raspberry Pi Zero W. This project was part of the coursework of the Embedded Systems module and was carried out in a group of 4 members.
            </p>
            <p>
                Integrating a particulate matter sensor, a pressue sensor, as well as a temperature and humidity sensor, CharIOT-CR01A allows real-time remote monitoring of enviromental conditions and gives classification based on ISO-14644-1 standards. All the data is stored in a database and visible on a webapp, which is able to support multiple sensing modules. An antenna module is also included, which provides a mean of backup communication in case Wi-Fi becomes unavailable.

            <h3>Autonomous Rover (May-Jun 2022)</h3>
            <img src="/projects/Rover.JPG" alt="GUI" style="height:300px;">
            <p>
                A group project to design an autonomous rover capable of navigation, obstacle avoidance and mapping. The architecture was divided into the subsystems of drive, radar, energy, vision, command and control, which were allocated between the 7 group members and integrated gradually at various stages in the project. Including a two-core ESP32 as the central microcontroller, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) dedicated to vision, as well as an Arduino for power management, this autonomous rover project is a complex integration of hardware and software systems.

            <img src="/projects/analogue_synth.png" alt="Analogue Synthesiser" style="height:300px;">
            <p>
                A group project to design and simulate the circuit for an analogue music synthesiser. The circuit blocks include linear-to-exponential converters, voltage-controlled oscillators, triangle-to-sine converters, variable gain amplifiers, and output stages, which were allocated between the 3 group members. Additional functionalities include choice of waveforms, tremolo and vibrato modulation as well as attack-decay-sustain-release (ADSR) envelopping.
