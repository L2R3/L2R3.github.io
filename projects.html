            <h3>Tower of Hanoi solver (Jan-Mar 2023)</h3>
            <p>
                Programming an OpenMANIPULATOR-X to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle with an unkown starting configuration and without the use of additional sensors. The project was part of the coursework for Robotics Manipulation. Other tasks included moving and rotating cubes, as well as drawing simple geometric shapes. The Tower of Hanoi solver was demonstrated at the Great Exhibition Road Festival 2023 on the Manipulation and Touch Lab (MTL) stand.

            <h3>CharIOT-CR01A (Jan-Feb 2023)</h3>
            <img src="/projects/CR01A.jpg" alt="GUI" style="height:300px;">
            <p>
                A proof-of-concept cleanroom sensing IOT solution, written in Rust on Raspberry Pi Zero W. Integrating a particulate matter sensor, a pressue sensor, as well as a temperature and humidity sensor, CR01A allows real-time remote monitoring of enviromental conditions and gives classification based on ISO-14644-1 standards. All the data stored in a database and visible on a webapp, which is able to support multiple sensing modules. An antenna module is also included, which provide a mean of backup communication in case Wi-Fi becomes unavailable.

            <h3>Autonomous Rover (May-Jun 2022)</h3>
            <img src="/projects/Rover.JPG" alt="GUI" style="height:300px;">
            <p>
            A group project to design an autonomous rover capable of navigation, obstacle avoidance and mapping. The architecture was divided into the subsystems of drive, radar, energy, vision, command and control, which are separately allocated to the 7 group members and integrated gradually as various stages in the project. Including an two-core ESP32 as the main microcontroller, an FPGA specifically dedicated to vision, as well as an Arduino Nano for power management, this autonomous rover project is a complex integration of hardware and software systems.
